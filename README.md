# DevOps Testing Public Repository

In this repo we are maintaining resources required for the DevOps Testing application, that needs to be maintained outside the package.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

To deploy changes, raise a PR against the main branch. Once merged to main, the changes will start reflecting in the DevOps Testing application.
